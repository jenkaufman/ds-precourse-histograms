# ds-precourse-histograms

---

This repository holds the challenges for the [histograms lesson](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/content_link/github/gSchool/ds-precourse/units/07_matplotlib/04_histograms.md) for DSI precourse. You can find the assignment in the `notebooks` directory.

There are three plots for you to complete in the notebook and export to image files for grading. The instructions to do so are included in the assignment.

To complete the assignment, you must be sure to first fork and clone this repo, and if you aren't sure how to do that, you can look back to those instructions [here](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/content_link/github/gSchool/dsi-prep-module-setup/units/04_github/03_fork_clone_pull.md).

Don't forget that you can always find help in the [DS precourse slack community](https://dsi-precourse-g.slack.com) on the #ask_for_technical_help channel.
